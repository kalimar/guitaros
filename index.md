This patch is based on a Motown/Classic soul patch. We used the powerful 100w Mandarin Rocker, based on the OrangeÂ® Rockerverb 100 MKIII (Dirty Channel).
The idea was to use an amp with a lot of headroom so we could emulate the sound of playing into a recording studio console. The saturation and modulation
is provided by the Retro Reel modulation effect which emulates the sound of a reel-to-reel player. The Legacy Plate reverb was chosen to match the style of the time.
